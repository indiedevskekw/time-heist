# Time Heist

Time Heist is a multiplayer social deduction game where players are split into cops and robbers within bustling cities and towns. The cops and the robbers do not start with any information about each other. They must figure out who is on which side throughout the game. Robbers must outsmart their opponents and escape with their profits or be caught red-handed.
